# ML Classifier

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline using Python and scikit-learn.

It splits a dataset into training and testing sets, trains a logistic regression model, and prints accuracy.

I built this project to learn how data is split, models are trained, and predictions are evaluated.
